                Having a whole foods, plant-based diet is key to living a
                long and healthy life. Eating a diverse array of vegetables and fruits
                gives you a nutrient-rich diet and promotes positive gut
                health. Eating a largely plant-based diet also lowers your
                chances of preventable illness.
